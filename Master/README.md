Audio Processing and GUI

!USE PYTHON V 3.11, PYTORCH DOES NOT SUPPORT PYTHON V 3.12!

We will be using Python for this project so that the AI team's python code can run in our program.

We will be using PyTorch/TorchAudio to pull audio data from the default audio input, process it,
and send it to the default audio output. We'll start by making a program that reads a .wav file, processes it, and saves it 
to another .wav file. Once we find a good processing method, then we will bind it to the default audio in/out.

We will be using Tkinter to make a GUI for user inputs such as switching between processing modes.
